# Trigonometry-Graphs
<p> As I recall My mathematics days (School days) mainly Trigonometry, That made whole schooling and colleges around it and being asking doubts ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜‚.</p>
<p> So I decided to do code regarding all Trigonometric Angel functions like Sine, Cosine, Tangent (tan), Cotangent (cot), Cosecant (cosec) and secant (sec).</p>
<p> Firstly, I had Written a code for sine graph, cos graph and mix graph of sine and cos.</p>
<p>Then did similarly for remaining angles, then I used machine learning, specifically linear regression, to predict sine values based on randomly generated angles. It generates sample data, fits a linear regression model to the data, and then visualizes the original data points along with the predicted sine values. </p>
